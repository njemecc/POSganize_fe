# ðŸ“Š POSGANIZE - Membership management application

POSGANIZE is a full-stack web application built using React for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend. It serves as a membership organization tool and functions as an information system. There are two types of users: ADMIN and USER. The software is designed for clubs such as sports academies that offer various types of training memberships. An ordinary USER can purchase memberships for a specific period and attend the corresponding training sessions.


## Features

### ADMIN

- Access to the 'Users' page displays a list of all users with details including active membership status, allowing admins to view and manage memberships.
- Membership History on the "User Details" page enables admins to view a user's membership history and create new memberships.
- 'Dashboard' page provides graphical representations for selected time periods, displaying total income, attendance for each training, and the most popular training session.
- Access to the 'Trainings' page allows CRUD operations on individual training sessions and their schedules.
- 'News' page allows CRUD operations for posting sports-related news or club-specific updates.
- 'Rules Page' enables admins to manage club rules through adding or deleting rules.
Note: The admin account is pre-defined and represents the academy owner who purchases the software.

### USER
- Registration and login features with role-based authentication and UI rendering.
- Access to view training sessions and details without CRUD capabilities.
- Ability to add desired training sessions to the cart and proceed to checkout with:  [![Stripe Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Stripe-626CD9?style=for-the-badge&logo=Stripe&logoColor=white)](https://stripe.com/)
